## Ingredients
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter, browned
* 1 medium sweet potato cubed into 2-inch cubes
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 1 cup whole milk
* 1 3/4 cup water, divided
* 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 pound dried spaghetti pasta, cooked according to the directions on the box
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, more or less depending on heat preference, (Use paprika instead)
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions
* Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the cubed sweet potatoes and cook until fork tender. Carefully place sweet potatoes into a blender and puree until smooth.
* In a large pot over medium heat, add the brown butter and whisk together with flour for 30 seconds. Turn the heat up to medium-high and carefully add the milk and continue whisking until mixture thickens, about 3-4 minutes. At this time, add the pureed sweet potatoes and 1 1/2 cup of water. Let the mixture simmer for 5-7 minutes until thickened then add the Parmesan cheese, cayenne, salt, pepper, and turn off the heat. If the mixture seems too thick, you can add the remaining 1/4 cup of water to thin it out.
* Add the cooked pasta to the pot and toss until well-coated.

## Recipe Notes
How to brown butter: place butter in a skillet on medium heat. Immediately begin whisking it. It'll start to foam and within 2-3 minutes, brown bits will start showing up at the bottom. At this point in time, I usually will take the skillet off the heat and start swirling the butter around in the pan in the air so it doesn't quickly go from brown to burned. Once you see a nice brown color in the butter (and start smelling the amazingness), you've achieved brown butter awesomeness!
